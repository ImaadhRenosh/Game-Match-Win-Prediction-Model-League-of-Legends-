## Overview
League of Legends, a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, generates extensive data from matches, providing an excellent opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world data.

## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to develop a logistic regression model that can accurately predict the outcomes of League of Legends matches. By leveraging various in-game statistics, I aim to provide valuable insights and predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, VS Code

## Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Git
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation & How to Run
To set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ImaadhRenosh/League-of-Legends-Match-Predictor.git
    cd League-of-Legends-Match-Predictor
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required libraries using:
    ```
    import os

    # Change to a stable directory
    os.chdir('/home')  # Adjust based on your environment (e.g., '/root' or '/home/jovyan' in some cloud environments)

    # Install required libraries
    !pip install pandas --user
    !pip install scikit-learn --user
    !pip install torch --user
    !pip install matplotlib --user

    # Verify installations
    import pandas as pd
    import sklearn
    import torch
    import matplotlib
    print("Libraries installed successfully!")
    print("pandas version:", pd.__version__)
    print("scikit-learn version:", sklearn.__version__)
    print("torch version:", torch.__version__)
    print("matplotlib version:", matplotlib.__version__)

    # Import Required Libraries
    import torch.nn as nn
    import torch.optim as optim
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler 
    from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
    ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `match_predictor.ipynb` to train and evaluate the model.

### Task 3: Train the logistic regression model on the dataset
- Implement the train loop for a specified number of epochs.
- Make predictions and calculate the loss.
- Perform backpropagation and update the model parameters.
- Evaluate the model and print accuracy on training and testing sets.

### Task 4: Implement optimization techniques and evaluate the model's performance
- Implement L2 regularization in the optimizer (weight_decay parameter).
- Retrain the model with the same training loop.
- Evaluate the optimized model on training and testing sets.

### Task 5: Visualize the model's performance and interpret the results
- Import necessary libraries (matplotlib.pyplot, confusion_matrix, classification_report, roc_curve, auc).
- Generate and plot the confusion matrix.
- Print the classification report.
- Plot the ROC curve and calculate the AUC.

### Task 6: Save and load the trained model
- Use torch.save to save the model's state dictionary.
- Use torch.load to load the state dictionary into a new model instance.
- Set the loaded model to evaluation mode.
- Evaluate the loaded model and ensure consistent performance.

### Task 7: Perform hyperparameter tuning to find the best learning rate
- Define a list of learning rates to test.
- Reinitialize the model and optimizer for each learning rate.
- Train and evaluate the model for each learning rate.
- Print the best learning rate and corresponding test accuracy.

### Task 8: Evaluate feature importance to understand the impact of each feature on the prediction
- Extract the weights from the linear layer.
- Create a DataFrame with feature names and their corresponding importance.
- Sort the DataFrame by importance.
- Plot the feature importance using a bar plot.

## Usage
